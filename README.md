Here you can find these projects: 

**Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster**

Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster is a knowledge competition on Kaggle. Many people started practicing Machine Learning with this competition. This is a binary classification problem: based on information about Titanic passengers we predict whether they survived or not. General description and data are available on Kaggle. Titanic dataset provides interesting opportunities for feature engineering.

**End-to-end Data Analytics Project: Uber Dataset:**

In this project I took Uber dataset from Kaggle and first cleaned the data, before uploading it to SQL using sqalchemy and working on it using IPython magic commands. 
Finally, I used seaborn to visualize some of the data.
